## Note

This repository currently contains a state where the `kill` command in the _org.fipro.oneshot.command_ bundle is not working when using the _launch.bndrun_ or the _launch_equinox.bndrun_ are used to launch the runtime.

The reason is probably [FELIX-6726](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FELIX-6726) since Felix SCR 2.2.10. If you use Felix SCR 2.2.6 there is no issue with the `kill` command.

To show the error, the `KillCommand` implementation was modified to use the `ReferenceScope.PROTOTYPE_REQUIRED`, which leads to a deactivation of the `Hitman` instance after the `kill` command was executed.

```java
public class KillCommand {

	@Reference(scope=ReferenceScope.PROTOTYPE_REQUIRED)
    private OneShot killer;
```
